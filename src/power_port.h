/** Power Port class
 *
 * Stores actual measurements and voltage / current limits for external terminals or internal ports
 *
 * The signs follow the passive sign convention. Current or power from the considered system or
 * circuit towards an external device connected to the port has a positive sign. For all terminals,
 * the entire charge controller is considered as the system boundary and acts as a source or a sink.
 * For internal sub-circuits, e.g. the DC/DC converter circuit defines the sub-system boundaries.
 *
 * Examples:
 * - Charging a connected battery has a positive sign, as current flows from the charge controller
 *   into the battery, i.e. the battery acts as a sink.
 * - Power from a solar panel (power source) has a negative sign, as the charge controller acts as
 *   the sink and power flows from the external device into the charge controller.
 * - A DC/DC converter in buck mode results in a positive current flow at the low voltage side and
 *   a negative current at the high voltage side. The system boundary is the DC/DC sub-circuit,
 *   which sources current from the high side port and sinks it through the low side port.
